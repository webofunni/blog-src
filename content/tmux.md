Summary: Tmux settings that I am using

I am using tmux for almost 2 years now. I was using and a big fan of screen before that. But screen was replaced by tmux from the moment one of my colleages introduced me to a more actively deleoped tmux. 

Here I am documenting my Tmux configuration. Full configuration file is stored at [Github](https://github.com/webofunni/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/tmux.conf)
